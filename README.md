# My definitions
1. **Convolution**: A process of swiping a filter over input and recording each output such that entire input is procesed.
2. **Filters/Kernels**: An entity that extracts or emphasizes a particular feature into a channel.
3. **Epochs**: When our model sees i.e. is trained upon entire training data exactlyonce, its called an epoch.
4. **1x1 Convolution**: Convolving input channels with 1x1 filter, generally to compress the input channels into more informative fewer channels.
5. **3x3 Convolution**: Convolving input channels with 3x3 filter, generally to extract more informative channels by looking at the local neighborhood region.
6. **Feature Maps**: A collection of all similar features that a kernel extracts from a given input.
7. **Activation Function**: Directs how the kernel should be applied mathematically in order to highlight and extract needed features.
8. **Receptive Field**: The input pixels that a channel pixel is dependent upon. Local for previous input and global for original input.
